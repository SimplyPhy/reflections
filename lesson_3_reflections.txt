When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you don't have access to the computer with your work on it, or when you are adding to someone else's work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want to be bothered with constant updates in the middle of your workflow, especially if there are errors.  Also, perhaps there are changes that you don't want to interact with in your project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A fork is a clone inside of GitHub.  A clone is the copying of a file from one location to another, either remotely or otherwise.  A branch is a new version of a file that is connected to another branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

If you don't have an internet connection, you can still check differences between the two versions.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Without GitHub, you might maintain a master file in a cloud service for reference, and have different named files with highlighted changes shared within that cloud service.  You would message other contributors to look at your changes prior to adding them to a primary file.  This would be harder mostly because it wouldn't should differences as well, and a person could purposefully or accidentally incorporate different changes that might cause malware/bugs.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
